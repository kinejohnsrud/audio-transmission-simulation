Audio Transmission Simulation
=================

This is a small project written in java for a network computing course.

It is a really simple program that takes in a .AU audio file, and writes a new .AU file based on three parameters: packet size, loss probability, and loss policy used. The two loss policies are: Replay last packet received, or write a silenced packet in place of the lost packet(s).
